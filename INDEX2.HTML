<h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
<!-- order list -->
<ol>
    <li>Season the shrimp
        Put the peeled shrimp (thawed, if previously frozen) in a bowl. Add a sprinkle of flour and the spices (1 to 2 tsp smoked Spanish paprika, ½ teaspoon ground coriander, pinch of cayenne for a little heat and pinch of sugar, which is totally optional but does balance the flavors). Toss to coat and then set it aside for a little bit.</li>

<li>Sautee red onions, garlic, and bell peppers
    Garb a large skillet (I like to use cast iron), melt ghee and olive oil over medium heat. Add the red onions and garlic and cook for a little bit, 2 to 3 minutes or so until fragrant (be sure not to burn the garlic.) Add sliced bell peppers (I like to use a couple different colors) and cook, tossing occasionally, for 4 minutes or so.</li>

<li>Add the shrimp
    Now add the shrimp. Cook for 1 minute</li>
    <li>Add the tomatoes and liquid & Finish
        Now we add the liquid, diced tomatoes, broth, white wine and lemon juice. Submerge the shrimp in with your wooden spoon.
        Watch for shrimp to turn bright orange in color (remember, watch the thickets part of the shrimp, when that turns color, shrimp is ready.) Turn heat off and add a sprinkle of fresh parsley.</li>
